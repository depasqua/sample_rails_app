# Sample Rails App

This repo will hold a sample rails app developed in conjunction with following
various Rails guides.

Incremental development will occur with new features / examples being added to
the app over time. Note that I will provide a list of GitHub tags (releases) with
commit hashes and links so that one can see the changes as development occurred.
